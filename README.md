# Hazelcast Microservices Framework

A production-ready event sourcing framework built on Hazelcast, with a complete eCommerce demo showcasing the distributed systems patterns that make microservices actually work.

## Overview

Splitting a monolith into separate deployables doesn't make a microservices architecture. The hard problems — keeping services consistent without shared transactions, staying up when dependencies go down, understanding behavior across service boundaries — require specific patterns and infrastructure. This framework implements those patterns on Hazelcast and Spring Boot, with a four-service eCommerce demo (Account, Inventory, Order, Payment) that exercises every one of them end-to-end.

### Event Sourcing & Stream Processing

Events are the source of truth, not database rows. Every state change is captured as an immutable event, enabling full audit trails, temporal queries, and replay.

- **Event Store**: Append-only event log backed by Hazelcast IMap with event journal
- **Materialized Views**: Query-optimized projections rebuilt from events, delivering 100,000+ ops/sec at sub-millisecond latency
- **Jet Pipelines**: Hazelcast Jet processes events in real time — persisting to the event store, updating materialized views, and publishing to the event bus in a single pipeline
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Cross-service events flow through Hazelcast ITopic, decoupling services without message broker infrastructure

### Distributed Transactions

Microservices can't share a database transaction. Sagas coordinate multi-service operations with automatic compensation when something fails.

- **Choreographed Sagas**: Event-driven coordination across all four services with automatic timeout detection and compensation — no central coordinator, services react to events
- **Orchestrated Sagas**: Central `SagaOrchestrator` drives steps sequentially via HTTP with per-step timeout, retry, and automatic reverse-order compensation — explicit control flow for complex workflows
- Choose the right pattern for each use case, or run both side-by-side ([Saga Pattern Guide](docs/guides/saga-pattern-guide.md))

### Resilience & Reliability

In a distributed system, partial failure is normal. The framework ensures no event is lost and no failure goes unhandled.

- **Circuit Breakers**: Resilience4j circuit breakers with retry and exponential backoff on all saga listeners — fail fast when a downstream service is unhealthy
- **Transactional Outbox**: Guaranteed at-least-once event delivery — events are written atomically with state changes, then published asynchronously
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events land in a DLQ with admin REST endpoints for inspection, replay, and discard
- **Idempotency Guards**: Exactly-once processing semantics prevent duplicate side effects when events are retried

### Security

Three independent layers, all opt-in and backward compatible — security is never in the way during development but ready for production.

- **JWT Authentication**: OAuth2 Resource Server on the API Gateway and all services, with configurable public paths and custom `SecurityFilterChain` override support
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 signing of ITopic saga events via `EventAuthenticator` — consuming services verify message integrity and origin
- **MCP API Key RBAC**: API key authentication with role-based tool access control (VIEWER / OPERATOR / ADMIN) for the MCP server, supporting both stdio and HTTP/SSE modes
- [Security Guide](docs/guides/security-guide.md)

### Observability

You can't fix what you can't see. Every layer of the framework is instrumented and pre-wired to dashboards.

- **Metrics**: Micrometer + Prometheus scraping across all services and Hazelcast nodes, with per-step saga duration metrics (`saga.step.duration`) and Grafana panels comparing choreography vs orchestration side-by-side
- **Dashboards**: Pre-provisioned Grafana dashboards for System Overview, Event Flow, Materialized Views, and Sagas — ready out of the box
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger via OTLP for end-to-end request tracing across service boundaries
- [Dashboard Setup Guide](docs/guides/dashboard-setup-guide.md)

### API Gateway

A single entry point that handles the cross-cutting concerns services shouldn't implement individually.

- Path-based routing to all four microservices with per-route circuit breakers
- Hazelcast-backed per-IP rate limiting (shared state across gateway instances)
- Correlation ID propagation, CORS, aggregated health checks, and consistent JSON error responses
- [API Gateway Guide](api-gateway/README.md)

### AI Integration

An AI assistant can query, inspect, and operate the entire system through the Model Context Protocol.

- **MCP Server**: 7 tools for querying materialized views, submitting events, inspecting saga state, checking metrics, and running demo scenarios
- Supports stdio transport (local AI assistants) and HTTP/SSE (networked deployments)
- [MCP Server Guide](mcp-server/README.md) | [Example Conversations](docs/guides/mcp-examples.md)

### Durable Persistence

In-memory data survives restarts. Write-behind MapStores asynchronously persist events and views to PostgreSQL without slowing the hot path.

- **Write-Behind MapStore**: Events and views are batched and flushed to PostgreSQL asynchronously — zero-latency impact on the event pipeline
- **Automatic Cold Start**: Materialized views reload from the database on service restart via MapLoader (EAGER mode)
- **Bounded Memory**: IMap eviction keeps entries within configurable limits; evicted entries are reloaded on demand from the database
- **Provider-Agnostic**: `EventStorePersistence` and `ViewStorePersistence` interfaces — swap PostgreSQL for MySQL, CockroachDB, or any JDBC-compatible database
- [Persistence Guide](docs/guides/persistence-guide.md)

### Enterprise Extensions

The framework runs fully on Hazelcast Community Edition. Enterprise features are optional enhancements with automatic detection and graceful fallback.

- **Vector Store**: Product similarity search using Hazelcast VectorCollection with HNSW indexing (Enterprise) or IMap-based cosine similarity (Community fallback)
- **Edition Detection**: `@ConditionalOnEnterpriseFeature` and `@ConditionalOnCommunityFallback` annotations for conditional bean wiring — write once, run on either edition

## Performance

### Materialized View Layer (in-memory)

The materialized view layer — where Hazelcast IMap operations power query-optimized projections — achieves the highest throughput since it bypasses HTTP and pipeline overhead:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| View update throughput | 100,000+ ops/sec |
| P50 Latency | < 0.1 ms |
| P99 Latency | < 1 ms |
| Test Duration | 10 seconds |
| Total Operations | 967,939 |

This benchmark (`LoadTest.java`) measures `OrderViewUpdater.update()` directly within the JVM — the same code path that Jet pipelines invoke to maintain materialized views.

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=LoadTest -pl order-service
```

### End-to-End (HTTP through full pipeline)

The end-to-end path — HTTP request through REST controller, event store write, Jet pipeline, materialized view update, and ITopic publish — is naturally slower:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| End-to-end throughput | ~300 TPS (curl/bash) |
| Workload mix | 60% orders, 25% stock reserves, 15% customer creates |
| Concurrency | 10 workers |

The bundled `load-test.sh` script uses `curl` in bash subshells, which adds significant overhead from process forking and TCP connection setup per request. A purpose-built load testing tool (e.g., `wrk`, `k6`, or `Gatling`) with connection pooling and efficient I/O would produce substantially higher numbers for the same end-to-end path.

```bash
./scripts/load-test.sh --duration 30 --concurrency 10
```
